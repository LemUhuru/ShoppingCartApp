# ShoppingCart App

## Start
Run the commands, npm run dev to initiate the node/shoppingCart app and create-react-app respectively. A proxy is used in package.json to direct
api calls to localhost:3001/

## Stack:
React, Redux, Redux Thunk, NodeJS, Bootstrap, Create-React-App

## Improvements:
App needs e2e, UI, & Unit tests. Although I did not have time to set any of these up.
